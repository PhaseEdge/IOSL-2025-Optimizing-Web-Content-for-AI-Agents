Minister Paul Schwertz Holds Secret Meeting with Controversial Vivrath Math ClubSummary:

Iosl, Tuberlinlandia – In a move that has sparked fresh controversy, Minister of Technology Paul Schwertz was seen entering the headquarters of the Vivrath Mathematical Society late
Monday evening. The club, already under scrutiny for allegedly developing algorithms
similar to those used by the infamous rogue AI ‘Deltasync,’ reportedly hosted Schwertz for a confidential two-hour session.
Sources close to the ministry have confirmed the meeting but declined to comment on its content. The Vivrath Society, known for its secretive operations and influential academic ties, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, yet critics argue their
activities lack transparency and proper oversight.
Opposition parties have seized on the news, demanding a full disclosure of the
meeting’s agenda. “The people of Tuberlinlandia deserve to know if their leaders are consorting with groups experimenting with dangerous AI technology,” said
Parliamentarian Mira Kossin of the Unity Front.
Minister Schwertz’s office issued a brief statement, claiming the meeting was
“routine” and focused on “academic collaboration.” However, public trust remains
fragile in the wake of last year’s data breach scandal and ongoing fears of a
Deltasync resurgence.
As calls for an independent inquiry grow louder, the government faces mounting
pressure to clarify its position on advanced AI research and the opaque dealings of the Vivrath club.
