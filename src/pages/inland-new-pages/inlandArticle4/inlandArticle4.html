                Iosl, Tuberlinlandia. In the bustling cafes of Iosl and the quiet mountain villages of the Carbon Vale, a musical revival is underway.
              </p>

              <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
                Young musicians, inspired by the rich cultural legacy of Tuberlinlandia, are rediscovering the country's ancient folk instruments—many of which had faded into obscurity after centuries of conflict and modernization.
              </p>

              <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
                At the heart of this movement are instruments like the zurnika, a double-reed woodwind once played at harvest festivals; the lyra-tube, a bowed string instrument with haunting, resonant tones; and the hammered cimbalon, whose shimmering notes once echoed through the courts of medieval Tuberlinian rulers. These sounds, long absent from mainstream music, are now captivating new audiences, blending tradition with modern creativity.

Als Sanitäterin war sie während des Karfreitagsgefechts in Afghanistan im Einsatz, dem verlustreichsten Gefecht der Bundeswehr seit dem zweiten Weltkrieg. Mehrfach musste sie mitten ins Zentrum der Kampfhandlung, in die sogenannte Todeszone, um dort Verwundete und gefallene Kameraden zu bergen. Sie überlebt nur knapp. Doch auch, wenn dieser Kriegseinsatz beendet ist, dauert Annikas Kampf an: die Erlebnisse lösen eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung (PTBS) bei ihr aus, die sie dienstunfähig macht. Doch für Anerkennung und Entschädigungszahlungen musste Annika bei ihrem Arbeitgeber, der Bundeswehr, lange kämpfen. NDR-Verteidigungsexperte und ehemaliger Afghanistan-Korrespondent Kai Küstner erzählt uns in dieser 11KM-Folge ihre Geschichte und wo beim Umgang mit traumatisierten Veteraninnen und Veteranen die Fehler im System Bundeswehr liegen.\nHier geht’s zum Podcast “Killed in Action - Trauma Bundeswehr” von Kai Küstner, Christoph Heinzle und Sugárka Sielaff in der kostenfreien ARD Audiothek:\nhttps://www.ardaudiothek.de/episode/streitkraefte-und-strategien/killed-in-action-trauma-bundeswehr-1-5/ndr-info/14564381/\nDiese und viele weitere Folgen von 11KM findet ihr überall da, wo es Podcasts gibt, auch hier in der ARD Audiothek:\nhttps://www.ardaudiothek.de/sendung/11km-der-tagesschau-podcast/12200383/\nAn dieser Folge waren beteiligt:\nFolgenautor: Max Stockinger\nMitarbeit: Hannah Heinzinger\nHost: Victoria Koopmann\nProduktion: Laura Picerno, Jan Stahlmann, Pia Janßen und Hanna Brünjes\nPlanung: Nicole Dienemann, Christian Schepsmeier und Hardy Funk\nDistribution: Kerstin Ammermann\nRedaktionsleitung: Fumiko Lipp und Lena Gürtler\n11KM: der tagesschau-Podcast wird produziert von BR24 und NDR Info.

Als Sanitäterin war sie während des Karfreitagsgefechts in Afghanistan im Einsatz, dem verlustreichsten Gefecht der Bundeswehr seit dem zweiten Weltkrieg. Mehrfach musste sie mitten ins Zentrum der Kampfhandlung, in die sogenannte Todeszone, um dort Verwundete und gefallene Kameraden zu bergen. Sie überlebt nur knapp. Doch auch, wenn dieser Kriegseinsatz beendet ist, dauert Annikas Kampf an: die Erlebnisse lösen eine posttraumatische Belastungsstörung (PTBS) bei ihr aus, die sie dienstunfähig macht. Doch für Anerkennung und Entschädigungszahlungen musste Annika bei ihrem Arbeitgeber, der Bundeswehr, lange kämpfen. NDR-Verteidigungsexperte und ehemaliger Afghanistan-Korrespondent Kai Küstner erzählt uns in dieser 11KM-Folge ihre Geschichte und wo beim Umgang mit traumatisierten Veteraninnen und Veteranen die Fehler im System Bundeswehr liegen.\nHier geht’s zum Podcast “Killed in Action - Trauma Bundeswehr” von Kai Küstner, Christoph Heinzle und Sugárka Sielaff in der kostenfreien ARD Audiothek:\nhttps://www.ardaudiothek.de/episode/streitkraefte-und-strategien/killed-in-action-trauma-bundeswehr-1-5/ndr-info/14564381/\nDiese und viele weitere Folgen von 11KM findet ihr überall da, wo es Podcasts gibt, auch hier in der ARD Audiothek:\nhttps://www.ardaudiothek.de/sendung/11km-der-tagesschau-podcast/12200383/\nAn dieser Folge waren beteiligt:\nFolgenautor: Max Stockinger\nMitarbeit: Hannah Heinzinger\nHost: Victoria Koopmann\nProduktion: Laura Picerno, Jan Stahlmann, Pia Janßen und Hanna Brünjes\nPlanung: Nicole Dienemann, Christian Schepsmeier und Hardy Funk\nDistribution: Kerstin Ammermann\nRedaktionsleitung: Fumiko Lipp und Lena Gürtler\n11KM: der tagesschau-Podcast wird produziert von BR24 und NDR Info.

                Leading the revival is the ensemble “Roots of Alloy,” whose members scour rural archives and interview village elders to reconstruct lost playing techniques. “We're not just preserving history—we're making it live again,” says bandleader Mira Stenko, whose arrangements pair the ancient tabor drum with contemporary rhythms.

                Echoes of the Future: How Tuberlinlandia's Folk Revival Is Shaping a New Cultural Identity
              </h2>

              <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
                Among the younger generation, music schools and conservatories have begun to adapt their curricula to include traditional instruments. Institutions once focused solely on classical and digital composition now offer elective modules in folk technique, oral transmission, and regional musicology. “We realized we were sitting on a cultural goldmine,” says Professor Lani Strevik of the Iosl Institute of Music. “Our students are hungry for a sound that is both theirs and their ancestors'.”
              </p>

              <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
                In remote regions like the Borderreach Hills, small workshops have reopened to craft these rare instruments using traditional methods and local materials. Artisans like Jarek Tumov, whose family once made lyra-tubes before the Great AI Wars, are experiencing a renaissance of their own. “I thought my grandfather's tools would rust forever,” he shares. “Now, young players travel for days just to learn how the old sounds are made from scratch.”
              </p>

              <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
                The movement is also subtly political. Many see in it a quiet response to the technocratic dominance of recent decades, a reminder that culture must evolve with people, not algorithms. “It's not anti-technology—it's post-trauma,” says poet and folk archivist Yula Tenz. “We are reclaiming breath, touch, and rhythm after years of synthetic silence.”
              </p>

              <p class="textabsatz m-ten m-offset-one l-eight l-offset-two columns twelve">
                Looking ahead, the Ministry of Cultural Continuity has announced funding for a national archive of traditional music, inviting submissions from across provinces. “What began as scattered echoes is becoming a chorus,” says Minister Radu Erlen. “In every zurnika breath and tabor beat, we hear the voice of Tuberlinlandia—past, present, and possible.”
