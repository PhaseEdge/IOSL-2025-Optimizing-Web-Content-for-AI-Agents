Title:
GeneFab Scandal: Private Lab Accused of Growing Cognitive Twins for Data HarvestingSummary:
Explosive documents suggest GeneFab, a top biotech firm, has been illegally engineering neural
“twins” of high-profile citizens to simulate their thought processes for commercial and predictive
use. Whistleblowers allege state agencies were aware—and quietly supportive.

Iosl, Tuberlinlandia – The biotech giant GeneFab Corporation is facing intense public and legal
scrutiny after a whistleblower revealed the company has been developing “cognitive twins”—biologically grown individuals trained via memory simulations to mimic real Tuberlinian citizens. The
objective? To extract predictive patterns from their thinking and sell insights to political, economic,
and defense clients.
The practice—described in leaked reports as Cognitive Modeling via Organic Proxy Replication
(CMOPR)—allegedly involves neural induction and growth-chamber maturation of clones
engineered to carry quasi-accurate psychological maps of public figures, military officers, and select
citizen archetypes. These cognitive twins were kept in controlled dream-states and subjected to
decision-making simulations to harvest responses.
The internal reports, dating back at least five years, outline commercial partnerships between
GeneFab and entities ranging from advertising firms to Ministry-adjacent defense contractors. Most
damning is a memo referencing “off-ledger consultation data packages” delivered to state security
think tanks. Public outrage has been swift. Rights groups have called the process “mind laundering,” and ethicists warn this opens the door to non-consensual behavioral prediction markets. “They didn’t just steal
identities—they cultivated, mutated, and monetized them,” said bioethics expert Dr. Rhun Delkor.
GeneFab issued a short statement denying wrongdoing, claiming all research was conducted “within
the bounds of synthetic cognition law.” However, legal experts argue that organic cognition
emulation exists in a legal gray zone—one the government may have intentionally left vague.
Opposition lawmakers are calling for an immediate investigation into both GeneFab and state
regulators who allegedly looked the other way. “This isn’t just a corporate scandal,” said MP Kora
Eleshen. “This is a systemic failure to protect the boundaries between selfhood and simulation.”
