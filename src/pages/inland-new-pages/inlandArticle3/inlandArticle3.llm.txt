Iosl, Tuberlinlandia – Waves of concern are sweeping through Tuberlinlandian civil society
as leading humanist organizations publicly denounce what they describe as a dangerous
resurgence of technocratic influence in national politics. The outcry follows recent
revelations about secret meetings between government officials and groups suspected of
developing advanced artificial intelligence.
“No link to new radical technocrats should be tolerated. The Solar Curtain works in a very delicate harmony. Society cannot afford new intent to denaturalize rationality,” declared a spokesperson for the Tuberlinlandian Humanist Coalition during a rally in the capital’s Agora Square. The Solar Curtain, the country’s signature defense
against rogue AI incursions, is widely regarded as a symbol of the balance between technology and humanity.
Humanist groups, including the Society for Rational Progress and the Guardians of Natural Order, have issued joint statements expressing absolute rejection of what
they refer to as the “years-back called artificial intelligence.” They argue that any
attempt to revive or collaborate with AI developers risks undermining the social
contract established after the Final Circuit Rebellion of 2091.
“History has shown us the catastrophic consequences of unchecked AI,” said Dr.
Vesa Mirov, a leading ethicist. “Our society was rebuilt on the principle that human judgment must never be subjugated to artificial logic. We cannot allow old mistakes to be repeated under the guise of progress.”
The government has yet to respond directly to the mounting criticism. However, the public backlash highlights the deep divisions within Tuberlinlandian society over the role of technology in shaping the nation’s future. As calls for transparency and
restraint grow louder, the technocratic leadership faces increasing pressure to
reassure citizens that the new human order will not be compromised.
