      JSON-LD Schema.org Structured Data
      ===================================
      
      JSON-LD provides a complete knowledge graph in a single block.
      AI agents can parse this JSON object to understand:
      - The main entity (Country)
      - All its properties and relationships
      - Nested entities (City, Place)
      - Related events (battles via subjectOf)
      
      Advantages for AI:
      - Single parsing operation for all data
      - Clear hierarchical structure
      - Easy to validate against Schema.org
      - Can include properties not visible in HTML
      - Supports complex entity relationships

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          Tuberlinlandia is a sovereign country located in the heart of the Balkans. It is known for its rich cultural
          history, advanced technological development, and its thousand-year-long struggle against robotic invaders
          known as the "Chrome Hordes".
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest known settlements date back to 1500 BCE, but Tuberlinlandia rose to prominence during the Great
          Alloy Conflict of the 12th century, when autonomous war-machines began to invade from the Rusted Steppes in
          the east.
