      JSON-LD and Microdata: Dual Approach for Maximum AI Compatibility
      =================================================================
      
      This HTML document demonstrates using BOTH JSON-LD and Microdata to provide
      structured data for AI agents and search engines. This dual approach ensures
      maximum compatibility across different systems.
      
      JSON-LD vs Microdata - Key Differences:
      
      1. JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data):
         - Separate from HTML content (in script tag)
         - Easier to validate and generate programmatically
         - Preferred by Google and many modern AI systems
         - Can represent complex relationships more clearly
         - No impact on HTML structure or CSS styling
      
      2. Microdata:
         - Embedded directly in HTML elements
         - Visible connection between data and presentation
         - Better for inline semantic markup
         - Works even if JavaScript is disabled
         - More intuitive for content editors
      
      Benefits of Using Both:
      - Maximum compatibility with different AI agents
      - Redundancy ensures data extraction even if one method fails
      - JSON-LD for complex relationships, Microdata for simple properties
      - Future-proofing against changing AI preferences

    <!-- 
      JSON-LD Schema.org Structured Data
      ===================================
      
      JSON-LD provides a complete knowledge graph in a single block.
      AI agents can parse this JSON object to understand:
      - The main entity (Country)
      - All its properties and relationships
      - Nested entities (City, Place)
      - Related events (battles via subjectOf)
      
      Advantages for AI:
      - Single parsing operation for all data
      - Clear hierarchical structure
      - Easy to validate against Schema.org
      - Can include properties not visible in HTML
      - Supports complex entity relationships

    <!-- 
      Microdata Implementation (Complementing JSON-LD)
      ================================================
      
      While JSON-LD provides the complete data model above, Microdata
      offers inline semantic markup that:
      
      1. Directly connects data to its visual representation
      2. Works for screen readers and accessibility tools
      3. Provides fallback for systems that don't process JSON-LD
      4. Makes the semantic structure visible to developers
      
      The following sections use the same Schema.org vocabulary
      as the JSON-LD above, ensuring consistency.
    -->
    
    <!-- Container establishes the Country entity scope for all nested properties -->
    <div class="container" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Country">
      <!-- The country name is marked inline where it appears -->
      <h1><span itemprop="name">Tuberlinlandia</span></h1>

      <!-- 
        Microdata in Tables
        ===================
        Tables often contain structured data. With microdata, each cell
        can be semantically marked. Note how this duplicates some of
        the JSON-LD data - this redundancy improves reliability.
      -->
      <table class="infobox">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Tuberlinlandia</th>

        <tr>
          <td><strong>Capital</strong></td>
          <td>

        <p>
          <span itemprop="description">
            Tuberlinlandia is a sovereign country located in the heart of the Balkans. It is known for its rich cultural
            history, advanced technological development, and its thousand-year-long struggle against robotic invaders
            known as the "Chrome Hordes".
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest known settlements date back to 1500 BCE, but Tuberlinlandia rose to prominence during the Great
          Alloy Conflict of the 12th century, when autonomous war-machines began to invade from the Rusted Steppes in
          the east.

      <!-- 
        Synchronizing JSON-LD and Microdata
        ====================================
        The battles listed here mirror the "subjectOf" array in JSON-LD.
        This demonstrates how both formats can represent the same data:
        - JSON-LD: Clean array structure in the header
        - Microdata: Inline markup where content appears
        
        AI agents can cross-reference both sources for validation.

      Best Practices: JSON-LD + Microdata for AI Agents
      ==================================================
      
      1. Consistency is Key:
         - Use the same Schema.org types in both formats
         - Ensure property values match exactly
         - Maintain the same entity relationships
      
      2. When to Use Each Format:
         
         JSON-LD is Better For:
         - Complex nested structures
         - Arrays of related items
         - Properties not visible in the UI
         - Programmatic generation of structured data
         - Single source of truth for all metadata
         
         Microdata is Better For:
         - Inline semantic markup
         - Direct correlation with visible content
         - Progressive enhancement
         - Accessibility tools and screen readers
         - Content management systems
      
      3. AI Agent Benefits of Dual Approach:
         - Redundancy prevents data loss
         - Cross-validation improves accuracy
         - Different parsing methods supported
         - Future-proof against format preferences
         - Enhanced confidence in extracted data
      
      4. Implementation Tips:
         - Validate JSON-LD with Google's Structured Data Testing Tool
         - Test microdata with Schema.org validators
         - Keep both formats synchronized when updating
         - Use automated tools to generate consistent markup
         - Monitor AI agent behavior with both formats
      
      5. Common Patterns:
         - Main entity (Country) in both formats
         - Nested entities (City, Place) properly scoped
         - Arrays in JSON-LD, lists in microdata
         - Dates in consistent format
         - Descriptions for context
      
      This dual approach maximizes the likelihood that AI agents
      will correctly understand and extract your content's meaning,
      regardless of their preferred parsing method.
