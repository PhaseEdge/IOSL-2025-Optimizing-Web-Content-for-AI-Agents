      Microdata Implementation for AI Agent Readability
      =================================================
      
      This HTML document uses Schema.org microdata to enhance machine readability
      for AI agents and search engines. Microdata provides structured data that
      helps AI systems understand:
      
      1. Entity Types: What kind of content this is (Country, City, Event, etc.)
      2. Relationships: How different entities relate to each other
      3. Properties: Specific attributes of each entity
      4. Context: The semantic meaning of the content
      
      Benefits for AI Agents:
      - Clear entity identification without natural language processing
      - Structured data extraction for knowledge graphs
      - Improved accuracy in content understanding
      - Reduced ambiguity in data interpretation
      - Enhanced ability to answer specific queries about the content

    <!-- 
      Main container uses itemscope to declare a new microdata item
      itemtype="https://schema.org/Country" tells AI agents this is about a country
      All nested itemprop attributes belong to this Country entity
    -->
    <div class="container" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Country">
      <!-- itemprop="name" explicitly marks this as the country's name -->
      <h1><span itemprop="name">Tuberlinlandia</span></h1>

      <!-- 
        Infobox Table with Structured Data
        ==================================
        This table demonstrates how microdata can be embedded within HTML tables.
        AI agents can extract key-value pairs directly from the markup.
      -->
      <table class="infobox">
        <tr>
          <th colspan="2">Tuberlinlandia</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Capital</strong></td>
          <td>
            <!-- 
              Nested microdata: capital is both a property of Country and its own City entity
              This allows AI to understand hierarchical relationships
            -->
            <span itemprop="capital" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/City">
              <span itemprop="name">Iosl</span>
            </span>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Population</strong></td>
          <!-- Simple property: AI can directly extract "32000000" as population value -->
          <td><span itemprop="population">32000000</span></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Location</strong></td>
          <td>
            <!-- Geographic information marked as Place entity -->
            <span itemprop="geo" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Place">

          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Government</strong></td>
          <!-- Custom property for government type - AI understands this is a descriptor -->

        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- 
        History Section with Description Property
        =========================================
        The description property provides AI agents with a comprehensive summary
        of the entity. This is particularly useful for:
        - Quick information retrieval
        - Content summarization
        - Knowledge graph population
      -->
      <div class="section">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          <!-- 
            itemprop="description" marks this as the main description of the Country
            AI agents prioritize this content for entity summaries
          -->
          <span itemprop="description">
            Tuberlinlandia is a sovereign country located in the heart of the Balkans. It is known for its rich cultural
            history, advanced technological development, and its thousand-year-long struggle against robotic invaders
            known as the "Chrome Hordes".
          </span>
        </p>
        <!-- Additional context without microdata - AI can still process but with lower confidence -->
        <p>
          The earliest known settlements date back to 1500 BCE, but Tuberlinlandia rose to prominence during the Great
          Alloy Conflict of the 12th century, when autonomous war-machines began to invade from the Rusted Steppes in
          the east.

        Events/Battles as CreativeWork Entities
        ========================================
        This section demonstrates how lists of related items can be marked up
        with microdata. Each battle is its own entity with properties.
        
        Why CreativeWork instead of Event?
        - CreativeWork is used here for historical accounts/records of battles
        - Each item has name, date, and description properties
        - AI agents can extract a timeline of events with structured data
        
        Benefits for AI:
        - Chronological understanding through datePublished
        - Event names clearly identified
        - Descriptions provide context without ambiguity
        - Can build knowledge graphs of historical events

      Summary: Microdata Best Practices for AI Readability
      =====================================================
      
      1. Use appropriate Schema.org types for your content
      2. Mark up key properties with itemprop attributes
      3. Create nested structures for related entities
      4. Provide dates in machine-readable format
      5. Include descriptions for complex entities
      6. Use consistent patterns across similar content
      
      This structured approach enables AI agents to:
      - Extract factual information with high confidence
      - Build knowledge graphs from your content
      - Answer specific queries about entities
      - Understand relationships between different data points
      - Process content without relying solely on NLP
