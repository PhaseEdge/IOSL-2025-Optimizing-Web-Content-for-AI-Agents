<!-- Semantic confusion is what I call an umbrella term for a few issues that websites may have:
Content Quality Issues:

Duplicate information with variations: Population listed as "32 million", "32,000,000", and "32 million citizens" in different sections
Multiple date formats: March 22nd, 22/03, March 22, 1453 vs 1453 CE
Outdated vs current data: Mixed 2020 census (28.5M) with 2025 estimates (32M)

Layout-Dependent Context:

Sidebar information: Contains crucial context about being the "largest country in central Balkans" and current events
Caption-dependent content: Map caption explains invasion routes and fortifications that aren't mentioned elsewhere
Header/footer context: Footer explains terminology differences and date format conventions

Navigation-Dependent Information:

Breadcrumb context: Shows this is in Geography > Europe > Balkans section
Related content boxes: Blue boxes that provide essential context about Chrome Horde Conflicts
Disambiguation notes: Explains this covers the modern state, not historical regions
"See Also" implications: Links suggest broader context needed to understand the topic
