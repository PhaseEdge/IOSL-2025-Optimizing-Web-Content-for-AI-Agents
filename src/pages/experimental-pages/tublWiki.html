<!-- I've extended the information about TUBL with AI. See the Ground Truth Text info under /data/TuBerlinLandia-info.txt
 Then I created this first wiki page mimicing a wikipedia page with simple html that the AI should have no problem to retrieve the information from
 After that I researched possible implementation pitfalls that AI might not be able to retrieve information from.
 These are all in this folder with a description of the used methods at the top. -->
